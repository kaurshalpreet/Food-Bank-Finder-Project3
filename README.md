# Food-Bank-Finder

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-BrightGreen)
  
## Description
Food Bank Finder was created as a tool to encourage generosity and
support those in need. Not just during the holiday season, but year
round. Food Bank Finder connects Californians to food banks near them
that are consistently serving our neighbors. Together we can make the
world a little better and help no one go hungry. <br>
This app will help you find the top three nearest Food Bank Locations. We have used the [socrata API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/controllerdata.lacity.org/v2mg-qsxf) to retrieve the locations by entering the zip code. <br> 
This app comes with the map snippet that can be used interactively to find the directions to the location.
